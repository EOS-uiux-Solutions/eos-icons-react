# Our "thank you" section

### Tested for every browser in every device

Thanks to [Browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com) and their continuous contribution to open source projects, we continuously test the EOS to make sure all our features and components work perfectly fine in all browsers.
Browserstack helps us make sure our Design System also delivers a peace of mind to all developers and designers making use of our components and layout in their products.
